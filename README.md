## Credit Approval System


### How to recreate the environment later using requirements.txt:

#### If you or someone else wants to set up the same environment on a fresh system, do this:

    Create a new virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv .venv

    Activate the new virtual environment:

source .venv/bin/activate

    Install all dependencies from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install exactly the same package versions that you had when you ran pip freeze.
